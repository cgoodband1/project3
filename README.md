# project3
My third project for Data Structures


*The project3 class implements the other classes with the tree object.  First the class inputs the Countries4.csv and splits the data by the comma and the splits the data into separate fields and finds the GDP per Capita. It then traverses the tree inorder. Then it deletes Australia, Norway, and Tunisia. Then traverses the tree with preorder. Next it searches for Sri Lanka, North Cyprus and, Tunisia. Then we delete Malawi, Somalia, Ireland, Greece and, Singapore. Then we traverse the tree in postOrder and print the bottom 10 and top 10 countries by GDP per Capita.
